# covid_data_analysis

Hi! This is my first dive into Data Science and Data Analytics! I am trying to create a Python Notebook which explores a Covid-19 dataset of the United States and explore various illustrations and try to analyze any conclusions/predictions from this dataset.

Additionally, I am also trying to make a Machine Learning model that can predict the spread of the Covid-19 cases based on the previously accumulated data.
